        "This teaching material serves as an introductory guide for educators, addressing fundamental concepts in data analysis and preparing students to navigate the complexities of different data types and dimensions. Understanding these principles is crucial for students to make informed decisions in their analyses and draw meaningful conclusions from diverse datasets. It focuses on the diversity and properties of data, emphasizing the need for teachers to understand and convey these concepts to students. The material highlights that not all data is the same and introduces key dimensions to consider when working with data.\n"

        "## The proposed practice\n",
        "\n",
        "In this educational module, educators are focusing on practical activities related to data exploration and analysis using Python programming language. The core tool employed is the use of dataframes, particularly with the pandas library. Educators in this module teach students how to explore and analyze data with the Python programming language.\n",
        "\n",
        "The practical activities involve reading a CSV file into a dataframe, with step-by-step instructions using Blockly, a visual programming language. Students learn to import the pandas library, read a CSV file into a dataframe, and explore ways to store and manipulate data efficiently. This hands-on approach allows students to understand the importance of dataframes in data science and gain proficiency in using Python for data analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, educators introduce data visualization using Plotly, focusing on essential plots such as line plots and bar plots. Students learn to import Plotly, create line plots to analyze trends over time, and generate bar plots for comparing and summarizing data. The emphasis is on understanding the significance of data visualization in uncovering patterns, trends, and correlations within datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "The experiment extends to statistical analysis, introducing concepts like quartiles and boxplots. Students utilize the pandas library to calculate quartiles for a specific dataset and create a boxplot to visualize the distribution of the data, helping them understand central tendencies and variability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, educators introduce histograms as a tool for exploring probability distributions of a variable. Students learn to interpret histograms to identify patterns, outliers, and overall distribution characteristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the educational practices aim to equip students with practical skills in data exploration, analysis, and visualization using Python, emphasizing the importance of dataframes and various plotting techniques for effective data science. The hands-on activities enhance students' understanding of data manipulation and interpretation, preparing them for real-world applications in the field."

        "## Not all data is the same\n",
        "\n",
        "When you hear people talk about \"data,\" you may get the impression that all data is the same.\n",
        "However, there are *many* different kinds of data.\n",
        "Just like we can compare animals by how many legs they have, whether they have fur, or whether they have tails, we can compare data along various *dimensions* that affect how we work with the data and what kinds of conclusions we can draw from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Is the data structured or unstructured?\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most basic properties of data is whether it is **structured.**\n",
        "It might surprise you to hear that data can be unstructured; after all, why would someone collect data that wasn't structured?\n",
        "And you'd be right: normally when people plan to collect data, they structure it.\n",
        "Structure means that the data is organized and ready for analysis.\n",
        "The most common kind of structure is **tabular data**, like you'd see in a spreadsheet.\n",
        "We'll talk about this more in a little bit.\n",
        "Databases are another common source of structured data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unstructured data usually comes about when the data collection wasn't planned or if people didn't know how to structure it in the first place.\n",
        "For example, imagine that you have a million photographs - how would you structure them as data?\n",
        "Textual data is another common example of unstructured data.\n",
        "If textual data were structured, in the way we're talking about, we wouldn't need search engines like Google to find things for us!\n",
        "When we work with unstructured data, we must take an extra step of structuring it somehow for our analysis, i.e. we have to turn unstructured data into structured data to do something with it.\n",
        "Again, images, audio, and text are common examples that need this extra step.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Is the data clean or dirty?\n",
        "\n",
        "Another basic property of data is **cleanliness**.\n",
        "If data is clean, then we don't need to correct it or process it to remove garbage values or correct noisy values.\n",
        "Just like with structured data, you might expect all data to be clean.\n",
        "However, even carefully collected data can have problems that require correction before it can be used properly.\n",
        "Dirty data is the norm for unplanned data collection.\n",
        "So unplanned data collection is more likely to result in *both* unstructured data and dirty data.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many ways that data can be dirty, but to make the idea more concrete, let's consider a few examples.\n",
        "Imagine that you are interested in the weather in your backyard, so you put out a battery operated thermometer that records the temperature every hour.\n",
        "You then leave it there for a month.\n",
        "Now imagine that it worked fine for the first two weeks, but since you didn't change the batteries, the measurements for the last two weeks become increasingly unreliable, e.g. reporting up to 10 degrees above or below the actual temperature, until it finally shuts off leaving you with no data for the remaining days.\n",
        "This kind of problem, an **instrument failure** leading to **unreliable measurement**, is actually quite common and can take a lot of planning to avoid.\n",
        "<!-- Another example of dirty data is at the recording stage.\n",
        "Imagine a computer is recording audio data by writing it to the hard disk.\n",
        "If the computer suddenly becomes active with another task (say streaming a video or installing an operating system update) the audio data may \"glitch\". -->\n",
        "\n",
        "While *very* dirty data is usually obvious, it can sometimes be hard to recognize.\n",
        "For this reason, it is important to check your data for problems (e.g. crazy values, like a person being 1 ft tall or 200 years old) and think very seriously about how problems should be corrected.\n",
        "Data cleaning is such a tricky topic that we will delay it until much later in the course.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Is the data experimental or nonexperimental?\n",
        "\n",
        "The last major dimension of data we'll talk about is whether the data came from an **experiment** or not.\n",
        "Why is this important?\n",
        "Knowing whether the data came from an experiment is important because it tells you if you can draw causal conclusions from it.\n",
        "When we talk about experiments here, what we mean are randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or an equivalent method of constructing a counterfactual.\n",
        "The basic idea with an RCT is that your **randomly** assign what you are studying (i.e. people, animals, etc) into **two or more groups**.\n",
        "In one of those groups, you do nothing - this is the control group.\n",
        "In one of the other groups, you **do something** to what you are studying - this is the treatment group.\n",
        "After the experiment, you can see what happened when you **did something** by comparing the treatment group to the control group.\n",
        "Since the two groups are the same in every other respect, you know that any differences are a result of what you did.\n",
        "This is why experiments allow you to draw causal conclusions - **because you only changed one thing, you know that change caused the difference you see.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's take a common example, vaccines.\n",
        "To discover if a vaccine against coronavirus is effective, I would randomly assign people to two groups.\n",
        "The treatment group would receive the vaccine, and the control group wouldn't.\n",
        "I would then follow up with both groups 1-2 months later and see which of them had gotten sick and which hadn't.\n",
        "If there was no difference in illness between the two groups, I'd say that the vaccine had no effect.\n",
        "Otherwise, I'd say the vaccine had some effectiveness.\n",
        "There's some subtlety we're skipping over here about *reliable differences*, but this is the basic idea.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's take another example of a non-experimental study.\n",
        "Some researchers sent a survey to a million people in Europe and asked them how much coffee they drank and how old they were.\n",
        "After analyzing the results, the researchers found that older people drank more coffee.\n",
        "Can we infer that coffee makes people live longer?\n",
        "No, we can't, because we have no control group to compare to.\n",
        "Without that control group, there are many other reasons that older people could be drinking more coffee.\n",
        "It could be that coffee is less popular now than 10 years ago, it could be that older people have more money to spend on coffee, or it could be some other reason we haven't thought of yet.\n",
        "When we have a non-experimental result like this, we have to be **very** careful about interpretation.\n",
        "The best we can say is that there seems to be an **association** between drinking coffee and being older, but we can't say what the cause is.\n",
        "We'll talk more about associations like this later on in the course.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Missing variables and misspecified models\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's return to the example of growing taller with age.\n",
        "If we collected a lot of data, we'd see this is a pretty strong relationship.\n",
        "However, is it the case that there are no other variables that determine height?\n",
        "Thinking about it more, we realize that nutrition is also an important factor.\n",
        "Are there other important factors?\n",
        "It turns out that air pollution is associated with stunted growth.\n",
        "We could go on and on here, but the basic idea is this: you may have identified some of the important variables in your model, and you may have identified the most important ones, but it is unlikely that you've identified *all* of them.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Measurement error\n",
        "\n",
        "Even if your model is perfectly specified, your data might be subject to measurement error.\n",
        "For example, let's say I'm interested in how many squirrels get run over in December vs. June.\n",
        "I might send out teams of students to walk up and down streets looking for dead squirrels.\n",
        "Some people on those teams might be very diligent and accurately count the squirrels, but others may not pay as much attention and only count about half of them.\n",
        "As a result, my model will be based on inaccurate data, which may lead me to draw the wrong conclusion.\n",
        "Almost all data has *some* measurement error, so this can be a real issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Generalization\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, my model may be specified well, and my data may be free of measurement error, but I may not be **sampling** my data in a way that allows for **generalization**.\n",
        "Suppose I'm trying to predict the outcome of the next election with survey data, and I only send surveys to farmers in Iowa.\n",

        "## Types of variables\n",
        "\n",
        "We've talked about structured vs. unstructured data already, but we haven't gone into detail about how structured data is created.\n",
        "Structured data begins with **measurements** of some type of thing in the real world, which we call a **variable**.\n",
        "Let's return to the example of height.\n",
        "I may measure 10 people and find that their heights in centimeters are:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Height |\n",
        "|--------|\n",
        "| 165    |\n",
        "| 188    |\n",
        "| 153    |\n",
        "| 164    |\n",
        "| 150    |\n",
        "| 190    |\n",
        "| 169    |\n",
        "| 163    |\n",
        "| 165    |\n",
        "| 190    |\n",
        "\n",
        "Each of these values (e.g. 165) is a measurement of the variable *height*.\n",
        "We call *height* a variable because its value isn't constant.\n",
        "If everyone in the world were the same height, we wouldn't call height a variable, and we also wouldn't bother measuring it, because we'd know everyone is the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "Variables have different **types** that can affect your analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Nominal\n",
        "\n",
        "A nominal variable consists of unordered categories, like *male* or *female* for biological sex.\n",
        "Notice that these categories are not numbers, and there is no order to the categories.\n",
        "We do not say that male comes before female or is smaller than female.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Ordinal\n",
        "\n",
        "Ordinal variables consist of ordered categories.\n",
        "You can think of it as nominal data but with an ordering from first to last or smallest to largest.\n",
        "A common example of ordinal data are Likert questions like:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "(1) Strongly disagree\n",
        "(2) Disagree\n",
        "(3) Neither agree nor disagree\n",
        "(4) Agree\n",
        "(5) Strongly agree\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Even though these options are numbered 1 to 5, those numbers only indicate which comes before the others, not how \"big\" an option is.\n",
        "For example, we wouldn't say that the difference between *Agree*  and *Disagree* is the same as the difference between *Neither agree nor disagree* and *Strongly agree*.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Interval\n",
        "\n",
        "Interval variables are ordered *and* their measurement scales are evenly spaced.\n",
        "A classic example is temperature in Fahrenheit.\n",
        "In degrees Fahrenheit, the difference between 70 and 71 is the same as the difference between 90 and 91 - either case is one degree.\n",
        "The other most important characteristic of interval variables is also the most confusing one, which is that interval variables don't have a meaningful zero value.\n",
        "Degrees Fahrenheit is an example of this because there's nothing special about 0 degrees.\n",
        "0 degrees doesn't mean there's no temperature or no heat energy, it's just an arbitrary point on the scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Ratio\n",
        "\n",
        "Ratio variables are like interval variables but with meaningful zeros.\n",
        "Age and height are good examples because 0 age means you have no age, and 0 height means you have no height.\n",
        "The name *ratio* reflects that you can form a ratio with these variables, which means that you can say age 20 is twice as old as age 10.\n",
        "Notice you can't say that about degrees Fahrenheit: 100 degrees is not really twice as hot as 50 degrees, because 0 degrees Fahrenheit doesn't mean \"no temperature.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## Measurement\n",
        "\n",
        "We previously said that structured data begins with measurement of a variable, but we haven't explained what measurement really is.\n",
        "Measurement is, quite simply, the assignment of a value to a variable.\n",
        "In the context of a categorical variable like biological sex, we would say the assignment of *male* or *female* is a measurement.\n",
        "Similarly for height, we would say that 180 cm is a measurement.\n",
        "Notice that in these two examples, the measurement depends closely on type of variable (e.g. categorical or ratio).\n",
        "\n",
        "How we measure is tightly connected to how we've defined the variable.\n",
        "This makes sense, because our measurements serve as a way of defining the variable.\n",
        "For some variables, this is more obvious than for other variables.\n",
        "For example, we all know what *length* is.\n",
        "It is a measure of distance that we can see with our eyes, and we can measure it in different units like centimeters or inches.\n",
        "However, some variables are not as obvious, like *justice*.\n",
        "How do we measure *justice*?\n",
        "One way would be to ask people, e.g. to ask them how just or unjust they thought a situation was.\n",
        "There are two problems with this approach.\n",
        "First, different people will tell you different things.\n",
        "Second, you may not really be measuring *justice* when you ask this question; you could end up measuring something else by accident, like people's religious beliefs.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we talk about measurement, especially of things we can't directly observe, there are two important properties of measurement that we want, **validity** and **reliability**.\n",
        "The picture below presents a conceptual illustration of these ideas using a target.\n",
        "\n",
        "<!-- Attribution: © Nevit Dilmen -->\n",
        "<!-- https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Reliability_and_validity.svg -->\n",
        "![image.png](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GC3XEykXEAArIAC?format=png&name=small)\n",
        "\n",
        "Simply stated, **validity means we are measuring what we intend to measure**.\n",
        "In the images, validity is being \"on target,\" so that our measurements are *centered* on what we are trying to measure.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, **reliability means our measurements are consistent**.\n",
        "Our measurements could be consistently wrong, which would make them reliable but not valid (lower left).\n",
        "Ideally, our measurements will be both valid and reliable (lower right).\n",
        "\n",
        "When it comes to validity and reliability, the most important thing to understand is that **validity is not optional.**\n",
        "If you don't have validity, your variable is wrong - you're not measuring what you think you're measuring.\n",
        "Reliability is optional to a certain extent, but if the reliability is very low, we won't be able to get much information out of the variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tabular data\n",
        "\n",
        "The most common type of structured data is **tabular data** which is what you find in spreadsheets.\n",
        "If you've ever used a spreadsheet, you know something about tabular data!\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example of tabular data, with *height* in centimeters, *age* in years, and *weight* in kilograms:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Height | Age | Weight |\n",
        "|--------|-----|--------|\n",
        "| 161    | 50  | 53     |\n",
        "| 161    | 17  | 53     |\n",
        "| 155    | 33  | 84     |\n",
        "| 180    | 51  | 84     |\n",
        "| 186    | 18  | 88     |\n",
        "\n",
        "In tabular data like this, each **row** is a person.\n",
        "More generically, we would say each row is an **observation** or **datapoint** (in statistics terminology) or an **item** (in machine learning terminology).\n",
        "In each row, we have measurements for each of our variables for that particular person.\n",
        "Since we have five rows of measurements, we know that there are five people in this dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can also think about tabular data in terms of **columns**.\n",
        "Each column represents a variable, with the name of that variable in the **column header**.\n",
        "For example, *height* is at the top of the first column and is the name of the variable for that column.\n",
        "Importantly, the header is not an observation but rather a description of our data.\n",
        "This is why we don't count the header when we are counting the rows in our data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Delimited tabular data - CSV and TSV\n",
        "\n",
        "You are probably familiar with spreadsheet files, e.g. Microsoft Excel has files that end in `.xls` or `.xlsx`.\n",
        "However, in data science, it is more common to have tabular data files that are **delimited**.\n",
        "A delimited file is just a plain text file where column boundaries are represented by a specific character, usually a comma or a tab.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's what the data above looks like in **comma separated value (CSV)** form:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Height,Age,Weight\n",
        "161,50,53\n",
        "161,17,53\n",
        "155,33,84\n",
        "180,51,84\n",
        "186,18,88\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "and here's what the data looks like in **tab separated value (TSV)** form:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Height\tAge\tWeight\n",
        "161\t50\t53\n",
        "161\t17\t53\n",
        "155\t33\t84\n",
        "180\t51\t84\n",
        "186\t18\t88\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice of the delimiter (comma, tab, or something else) is really arbitrary, but it's always better to use a delimiter that doesn't appear in your data.\n"
